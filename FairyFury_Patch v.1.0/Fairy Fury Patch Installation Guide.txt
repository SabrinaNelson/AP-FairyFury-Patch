HOW TO INSTALL - WINDOWS:

To install this patch, you need to locate one of the following possible directories:
- "C:\Program Files (x86)\Ahriman's Prophecy"
- "C:\Program Files\Ahriman's Prophecy"
*NOTE: The directory that you need may vary between which version of Windows you are using.

After that, rename the files - the ones in the directory for your copy of Ahriman's Prophecy -"RPG_RT.ldb" and "RPG_RT.lmt" to "RPG_RT.ldb.old" and "RPG_RT.lmt.old." This is so that you have back ups of the original files in the event that something goes wrong.

With the original files appended with ".old," you may proceed to copy the patched files included in this patch into the directory for your copy of Ahriman's Prophecy.

Enjoy spamming Fairy Fury - if you decide to go Enchantress.
